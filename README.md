# Solving-Poker
In this project, I will attempt to simulate a poker game (Texas Hold' Em) and use a large amount of iterations (n > 10^6) in order to determine what the best and worst starting hands are. Also, I will continue this data for select hands to see what your win percentage is for certain flop, turn, and river configurations in order to help poker players make informed bets.
