# Solving-Poker

In this project, I will use a data-driven statistical approach in order to develop and test an AI for Texas Hold'Em Poker.

The Project will progress in separate Phases:

1. Run 1-5 million simulations in order to determine the best (perhaps you could call it most powerful) hand pre-flop. Use a "smart" system of folding and re-raising based on Professional Poker players.

-- Learn SQL around here --

2. Repeat the same thing with flops! Run 100-500 million simulations here, using a smart Database to eventually store the data.

3. Use the data here to write a bot that can give recommendations to the player with certain hands and certain situations.
